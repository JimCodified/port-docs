# Define your portal

This page will guide you through defining the audience, goals, and use-cases for your developer portal.

### Define your audience

Define the groups of people who will use your portal. Common audience categories include:

- **Developers**: for routine tasks, collaboration, documentation, and sharing resources.
- **R&D managers**: for monitoring and tracking the performance and metrics of APIs and services.
- **Platform engineers**: for managing access control and creating experiences for developers.

### Define goals & use-cases

Define goals, user stories, and KPIs for your developer portal.  
Think about the problems you want to solve and the value you want to deliver to your users.

In this context, a user story is a goal or outcome that we want our end users to achieve.

Some common **goals** include:
- Increase developer productivity.
- Gain visibility into the health and performance of APIs and services.
- Improve collaboration between developers and R&D managers.
- Automate routine tasks and reduce manual work.

Some common **use-cases** include:

- SDLC management: For tracking the development lifecycle of services.
- Incident management: For tracking and resolving issues with services.
- API catalog: For monitoring the health and availability of an organization's APIs.
- Onboarding and tutorials: Step-by-step guides to help users get started quickly.
- Application security: For managing access control and security policies.

There are **many** other use-cases that you can implement in your developer portal, depending on your organization's needs.  
The key is to define these use-cases early on so that you can build your portal to support them.
