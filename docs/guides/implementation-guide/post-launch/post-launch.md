# Post-launch

Congratulations on launching your new developer portal! ðŸŽ‰

Portals are dynamic and need to evolve to meet the changing needs of your users and your organization.  

Repeating this cycle of **"plan, build, launch"** is essential to ensure that your portal continues to be a valuable resource for your users.

- Schedule regular reviews with relevant stakeholders to assess the portal's performance and usage.
- Habitually collect feedback from your users and incorporate it into your plans.
