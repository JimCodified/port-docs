# Launch

*This section will explain how to introduce your developer portal to your organization, and how to make it intuitive and easy to use for your users.*

### 1. Create a detailed homepage

- Add a detailed homepage to your portal with a readme that explains the purpose of the portal, the available self-service actions, and how to use them.
- Use the homepage to communicate announcements, updates, initiatives, and other important information to your users.
- Create useful visualizations that display data relevant for the logged-in user.
- Create a quick-access widget for links to useful pages, like the one in the [live demo](https://demo.getport.io).

### 2. Organize the software catalog

- Use folders in the software catalog to organize resources by type, team, or any other relevant criteria.
- Create additional catalog/dashboard pages for different personas in your organization.
- Show/hide columns in catalog pages to reduce visual clutter and make it easier for users to focus on the information they need.
- Organize specific entity pages:
  - Show/hide properties.
  - Show/hide related entities.
  - Create dashboards for specific entities.

### 3. Enable user feedback

- Create feedback components in your portal:
  - A self-service action to report issues and request features.
  - A dashboard for the platform engineering team to track and handle feedback.

### 4. Plan for ongoing maintenance and updates

- Create a process for updating the portal with new integrations, blueprints, and features.
- Set up automations to notify users about new features, updates, and changes to the portal.
