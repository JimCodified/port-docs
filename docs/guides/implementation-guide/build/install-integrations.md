# Install integrations

Integrations are the backbone of your developer portal. They allow you to ingest data from your tech stack and create a comprehensive software catalog.

### Install and configure pre-built integrations

- Install the relevant [integrations](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/) for tools in your tech stack.
- Configure each integration's [mapping](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-mapping) to ensure your desired data is ingested.  
  Every integration has a default mapping that can be customized to add/remove data fields.

### Set up custom integrations

- Create [custom integrations](/build-your-software-catalog/custom-integration/) to ingest data from tools not covered by pre-built integrations.
  - Create custom blueprints and relations for these integrations.
  - Configure the integrations' mapping to ensure all relevant data is ingested.

### Create logical connections between blueprints

Use [relations](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-data-model/relate-blueprints/) to define the logical relationships between the blueprints in your portal.
