# Set up RBAC

Port allows you to define roles and permissions to users, in order to control who can view, edit, and delete components in your portal.

### Configure SSO

Select the relevant [SSO provider](/sso-rbac/sso-providers/) and follow the instructions to set it up.

### Define ownership and permissions

- Assign [roles](/sso-rbac/rbac/) to users in your organization, defining their permissions when operating in the portal.
  
- Define your software catalog's [RBAC](/build-your-software-catalog/set-catalog-rbac/). This allows you to define CRUD permissions for each blueprint in your catalog.

- The final type of RBAC is [self-service actions permissions](/actions-and-automations/create-self-service-experiences/set-self-service-actions-rbac/). Port allows you to define which users can execute and/or approve actions in your portal.  
Since we have not yet set up any self-service actions, this step should be done in the next section.
